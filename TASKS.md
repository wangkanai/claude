# TASKS.md - Claude .NET Project Task Management

**READ BEFORE STARTING WORK** - This file tracks all project tasks and should be updated immediately when work is
completed.

## üìã Task Management System

### **Usage Guidelines**

1. **Check this file first** before starting any work
2. **Mark tasks complete immediately** when finished (change [ ] to [x])
3. **Add new tasks** as they're discovered during development
4. **Update task status** in real-time during work sessions
5. **Reference task numbers** in git commits: `feat: implement file reader (TASKS-1.2)`

### **Task Status Indicators**

- [ ] **Pending**: Not started, ready for work
- [x] **Completed**: Successfully finished and verified
- [üîÑ] **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- [‚ö†Ô∏è] **Blocked**: Waiting on dependency or decision
- [‚ùå] **Cancelled**: No longer needed or superseded
