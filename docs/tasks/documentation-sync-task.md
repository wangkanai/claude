# Documentation Synchronization Task

**Created**: 2025-07-23  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Purpose**: Synchronize all project documentation (PRD.md, CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, TASKS.md) to reflect current v2.0 enhanced architecture and progress

## Current State Analysis

### PRD.md (1199 lines)
- ✅ Already contains v2.0 enhanced requirements
- ⚠️ Development phases section needs updating to match enhanced 6-phase approach
- ⚠️ Missing recent session progress and accomplishments

### CLAUDE.md (702 lines)  
- ✅ Mostly updated with v2.0 architecture
- ⚠️ Shows outdated progress (26.7% instead of 36.4%)
- ⚠️ MCP integration section only references CLAUDE.local.md
- ⚠️ Missing Session 3 progress update

### PLANNING.md (194 lines)
- ❌ Still shows v1.0 - needs major update
- ❌ Old 6-phase structure over 20 weeks (needs 22 weeks)
- ❌ Missing NPM analysis, xUnit v3, Directory.Packages.props
- ❌ Technology stack outdated

### TASKS.md (177 lines)
- ❌ Shows old Phase 1 with 31 tasks (needs 45)
- ❌ Missing completed enhanced tasks
- ❌ Task categories don't match enhanced architecture
- ❌ Progress statistics outdated

## Update Strategy

Technology Stack: Add xUnit v3, Directory.Packages.props, NPM Analysis
Development Phases: Update all 6 phases to 22-week timeline
Current Status: Update to Enhanced Phase 1 (36.4% complete)
Key Decisions: Add NPM analysis, SESSION-STATE.md, MCP integration
```

### 2. TASKS.md Updates (Priority 2)
```markdown
Phase 1 Tasks: Update from 31 to 45 enhanced tasks
Completed Tasks: Mark 16 completed (11 enhanced + 5 from Session 3)

Progress: Update to 36.4% (16/45 tasks)
New sections: Enhanced Phase 1 tasks with proper categorization
```

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updates (Priority 3)
```markdown
Progress: 26.7% → 36.4% (16/45 tasks)
Session 3: Add accomplishments (4 completed tasks)
MCP Integration: Expand section with inline best practices
Next Priorities: Update based on remaining Phase 1 tasks
```

### 4. PRD.md Updates (Priority 4)
```markdown
