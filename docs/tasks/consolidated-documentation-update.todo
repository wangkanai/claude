  - [x] CLI implementation foundation (3 tasks)
  - [x] xUnit v3 testing framework setup (1 task)
  - [x] Directory.Packages.props configuration (1 task)
  - [x] SESSION-STATE.md template creation (1 task)
  - [x] Claude Code CLI documentation (1 task)
  - [x] Additional Session 1-2 tasks (4 tasks)
- [ ] Add new task categories:
  - [ ] NPM Package Analysis & Automation
  - [ ] Testing Framework & Coverage
  - [ ] Package Management & Dependencies
  - [ ] Cross-Platform Build System
  - [ ] Documentation & Architecture
- [ ] Update statistics:
  - [ ] Overall Progress: 16/45 (35.6%)
  - [ ] Enhanced Phase 1: 36.4% complete
  - [ ] Remaining Phase 1: 29 tasks
- [ ] Update Next Session Focus with current priorities

### [ ] 3. Update CLAUDE.md (Third Priority - Minor Updates)
- [ ] Update Phase 1 progress: 26.7% â†’ 36.4%
- [ ] Add Session 3 section (2025-07-23):
  - [ ] Claude Code CLI documentation research
  - [ ] xUnit v3 testing framework setup
  - [ ] Directory.Packages.props configuration  
  - [ ] SESSION-STATE.md template creation
  - [ ] Documentation consolidation
- [ ] Enhance MCP Integration section (lines 362-370):
  - [ ] Add inline MCP workflow examples

### [ ] 4. Update PRD.md (Lowest Priority - Mostly Current)
- [ ] Update Development Timeline to match enhanced 6-phase approach
- [ ] Add Session 3 progress in Development Sessions section
- [ ] Enhance MCP Protocol section with server priorities
- [ ] Ensure phase descriptions match other documents
- [ ] Update progress indicators

## Execution Order
1. PLANNING.md (most critical - wrong version)
2. TASKS.md (wrong task structure)  
3. CLAUDE.md (minor updates)
4. PRD.md (alignment only)

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All files show v2.0 Enhanced Architecture
- [ ] All files show 36.4% progress (16/45 tasks)
- [ ] Technology stack consistent across all files
- [ ] 6 phases over 22 weeks in all files
- [ ] MCP integration properly documented
- [ ] Session 3 progress included everywhere
- [ ] Cross-references remain valid
